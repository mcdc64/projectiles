# projectiles
A simulator that compares how projectiles behave with and without air resistance.
Requires numpy, matplotlib, tkinter and scipy.

Run the projectile.py file to start the simulator. You can reset the initial position and velocity of the two projectiles to
whatever you want. Their masses, drag coefficients, restitution coefficients, etc. are currently hardcoded and so can only be
changed by editing the .py file.
